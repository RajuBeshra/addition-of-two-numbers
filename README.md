Frontend development using React:

1) Create a React project using Create React App or any other method.
2) Create a form with two input fields for the two numbers to add.
3) Create a button to trigger the API call using Axios.
4) In the API call, pass the two numbers as a JSON object in the request body.
5) On receiving the response from the API, parse the JSON object and display the step by step addition process in the output area.
6) Validate the input fields using regex to accept only positive numbers.
7) Add a Readme file with instructions on how to run the frontend application.

For the backend services for the "Step Addition" project, the following tasks need to be completed using NodeJS + Express:

1)Set up a new Express project and create an endpoint for handling the API call.

2) Implement the POST method for the endpoint and validate the request body. The request body should contain two numbers, "num1" and "num2", and should only accept positive numbers as input.

3) Perform the step-by-step addition process as described in the "Explanation of Steps Generation" section. This involves adding the digits at the unit place, and then carrying over any values to the next place value.

4) Generate the JSON object of the step-by-step addition process and return it in the response body.

5) Write the documentation in the Readme file on how to run the backend services, including how to start the Express server and make API calls to the endpoint.

6) Finally, upload the code to Github and share the Github URL.

7) The complete backend solution will be responsible for providing the JSON object of the step-by-step addition process in response to API calls made from the frontend.
